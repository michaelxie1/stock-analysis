# stock-analysis
VBA Module #2

Overview of the Project:

The purpose of this project was to get a basic understanding of VBA and how it can be useful in helping within fields such as analyzing stock data. It created a simulation that would be similar to situations that we would receive in the real world, such as our boss asking us to analyze stock increase/decrease within a certain year. It allowed for us to understand VBA and fundamental aspects of coding, such as conditional statements, loops and variables.

Results:

Between 2017 and 2018, it is apparent that 2017 was a good year, as nearly all the stocks saw an increase within the return of their stocks. 2018 appeared to be the opposite, as most of the results were shown to have a decrease in return. In terms of execution time, using the original script was approximately .56 seconds. While using the refactored code, it was approximately 1/5 the time of the original code. Although both timeframes are both short, when dealing with larger amounts of data, the refactored code running five times as fast would save a lot of time in comparison to the original.

Summary:

When refactoring code, the process makes the entire script run faster as opposed to its original counterpart. It also lessens and makes the code look cleaner in the end, achieving the same result in a more organized manner. However, some cons with the refactoring process would be that it is extremely time consuming, with there being the possibility of you messing up the code even more. In those instances, it would be better to just restart the entire process instead of just trying to edit the code down. Within this particular VBA script, without the instructions to guide us, the process would have been much more arduous and there would have been a higher chance of making mistakes within the refactoring process.
